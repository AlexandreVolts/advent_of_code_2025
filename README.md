# AdventOfCode2024

My advent of code 2024 in Elixir.

## Commands

- `mix deps.get` - install required dependencies
- `mix run` - run the program

## Configuration

If you want to run specific exercises, you can directly edit the `mix.exs` file.

For any exercise to work, you will need to register on Advent Of Code's website and download data samples from your own account, put then inside a `/assets/` folder with the number of the day on a `.txt` format: First day: `0.txt`, second day: `1.txt`, etc.
